# Garage-system
I used AVR atmega32 modules (DIO,Timers),Servo motors, LCD, IR sensor
IR Sensor is used to detect the car , I used 2 IR sensors (one in the entry and the
other in the exit)
2022
Servo motor is used as the gate for entry and exit and is moved 90 degrees by using
fast PWM mode in Timer 1
LCD to show you number of cars in the garage and the number remaining so you can
park more
